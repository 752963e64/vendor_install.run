# vendor_install.run
Install anything from one bash script...

### Usage:
send either to /usr/local/bin or ~/bin... ensure your path is right with what you expect.

```shell
mkrun <vendor_name> <file_include>
# <vendor_name> will be vendor_name.run
# <file_include> is the file you wish to include for installation
# you need to check procedure by hand for installation through the script
# cuz I yet not brought an handy interface to it...
